# Use the following to calculate the percentage of students who passed math (math scores greather than or equal to 70)
passing_math_count = school_data_complete[(school_data_complete["math_score"] >= 70)].count()["student_name"]
passing_math_percentage = passing_math_count / float(student_count) * 100
passing_math_percentage

I had help from a tutor to create this code, and used it to create in the next block by just pasting "reading" over math.
